# length_of_burst_error
In order to detect burst errors of length "t" a code word is generated by appending "t" parity bits at the end (or beginning) of the message. The parity bits will be generated by doing an XOR of all of the bits separated by t bits. At the receiving end t equations are used to check the parity of the received codeword.
